# Dotfiles

Hey there 👋 These are the dotfiles I use every day to make my work life easier. I'm always tinkering with them and finding cool new tricks to speed things up. While these tools are my personal favorites, I thought I'd share them with you - who knows, you might find some hidden gems in here too. Feel free to poke around and borrow any ideas that catch your eye. And hey, if you've got any awesome tips of your own, I'd love to hear them.

> **⚠️ Warning**: Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!
